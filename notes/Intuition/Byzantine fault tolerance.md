4 generals surrounding the castle
They can only win if they come to a consensus

Commander and traitor, noone knows who the traitor is
How do you come up with a consensus protocol despite there being a traitor?
 - Commander can be the traitor

They can only communicate orally with each other

A consensus must be reached
The traitor is trying to avoid a consensus
So no matter what his orders, he must try to stop consensus

To what level is it tolerant???
 - Over 25% can not be traitors
 - Also used in airplanes, nuclear power plants etc
