Hash cryptography

Each person has a different fingerprint

SHA256 developed by the NSA

Very secure, open-source

1. `Secure Hash Algorithm` - 256 Bits in memory
2. 64 Characters - Numbers and letters
3. Hexadecimal - 0-9, A-F
4. Each character is `4 bits` (64x4=256)
5. Works for any digital entity

Always produces the same hash for the same data
changing 1 character changes the hash completely

### 5 Requirements for Hash algorithms
1. One-way - cannot go from the hash to the document
2. Deterministic - The same piece of data always has the same hash
3. Fast computation
4. Avalanche effect - any change alters the hash entirely
5. Must withstand collisions - Hash possibilities are not inifinite. If you have 10 pigeons and only 9 cages, you need to put 2 pigeons in one cage.
	1. Must also withstand manufactured collisions from hackers
