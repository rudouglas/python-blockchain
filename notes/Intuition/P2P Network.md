What prevents someone from changing all blocks? Or an input error changing them?

- Interconnected computers, not necessarily all connected to each other
- Blockchain is copied across all computers
- When a block is added, it is added across all computers
- The blockchain is constantly checking the peers to see if they match up. If a consensus is reached recognising that a blockchain node is incorrect, it will copy the correct blocks back, so hacking must be done across a majority of nodes for it to work
