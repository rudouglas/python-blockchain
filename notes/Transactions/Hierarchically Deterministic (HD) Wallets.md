The `Private Key` gives you privacy

This was an improvement made to Bitcoin

You have:
 - Master Private Key - Used by someone who needs to send Tx and create Private Keys
 - Master Public Key - Used y an auditor who needs to be able to see Tx but not do anything
 - Private Key (Multiples) - You could have one for each separate department and each could never know what the other is spending

Gives more oversight if you have an organisation
