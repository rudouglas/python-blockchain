# Private & Public Keys

Each wallet is given a `Private Key` 

You can generate a `Public Key` from the Private to share with others

Signature = Private Key + Message (Tx)

The receiver can verify it is from the sender using the Public Key

A `Verification Function` on the blockchain uses the Public Key and Signature to confirm this
