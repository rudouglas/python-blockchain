## The Halving
`The number of Bitcoins released into the system is halved every 4 years`

This is entirely controlled by the software
When block rewards reduce, the theory is that transaction fees will increase due to more demand, so it will still be economically viable to run nodes

## Block Frequency
How often do those blocks become availible that bring a reward

 - Bitcoin - 10 mins
 - Ethereum - 15 sec
 - Ripple - 3.5 sec
 - Litecoin - 2.5 min
