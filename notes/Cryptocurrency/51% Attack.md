Hypothetical attack

Not designed to tamper with individual blocks in the chain, so not 51% of the nodes, but of the Hash power

The malicious minders copy the chain and continue to mine blocks, without broadcasting them to the network, their chain gets longer because they have more hash power

Then they open up when their chain is longer and their chain wins, which means they can manipulate the transaction fees. They can buy things, then when the original chain is cancelled the tx's are cancelled so they get their money back, and then they don't include those transactions again

Then after ~72 hours the transaction is released from the Mempool back to the owner
