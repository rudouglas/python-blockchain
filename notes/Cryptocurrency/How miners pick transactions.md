Transactions get added to `MEMPOOL`

Tx ID & Fees

Fees are set by the exchanger so a miner will be more inclined to pick the higher fee transactions, which he will receive if he stores on the block

Because  of their processing power they will go through the Nonce range very quickly

Lets say he picks the top 5 transactions and goes through the Nonce range in less than a second, he will then choose the next highest transaction fee and swap it out for the lowest to add to another block and go through the nonce again. He does this until he solves the hash
