2 miners find a block around the same time, the chain diverges. Nodes closest to each copy the block over. Which ever chain mines the nex block wins the previous block

The transactions in the block go back into the Mempool, unless they were released in the winning block

Wait for 6 confirmations before considering your tx complete

Minimize the risk of double spending
