Nonce is not infinite
32-bit unsigned number
0 - ~4 billion

Difficulty = `1.5 x 10ˆ-23`
Nonce = `4 x 10ˆ9`
Probability = Difficulty x Nonce

A modest miner does 100 MH/s
4 billion / 100 million = 40 seconds

There is another field in the block called `timestamp` that updates every second, so you essentially only have 1 second to go through the entire nonce range in order to guarantee a golden 

Current hash of the network is 22 million trillion H/S
