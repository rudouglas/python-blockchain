Web 2.0 was a shift that led to videos, animation with the advent of Ajax and Javascript

Backend didn't really change much between Web 1.0 and 2.0

Web 3.0 backend moves to decentralized, this moves the sites closer to the user making the web faster. Control of your data is taken back. No central server required
