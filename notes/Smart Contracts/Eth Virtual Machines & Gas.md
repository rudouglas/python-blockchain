How did Ethereum solve the `loop` problem and the fact that all smart contracts are run on every single node?

### Security Threats
 - Viruses and access to private files
 - Infinite loops & Heavy Computations

### EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)
This is what runs the chain so they are self contained so don't have access to your computer

### Gas (Gwei)
For any computation run on the blockchain you need to pay gas fees, so the smart contracts run out of money if they run into infinite loops, so it encourages people to come up with efficient code

It is separate to Ether to keep the cost stable, so the conversion rate is adjusted between gas and ether
