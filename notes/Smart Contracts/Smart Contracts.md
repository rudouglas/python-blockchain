Programs which are run on the blockchain

A set of rules that parties agree on that governs the rule, similar to a program

`Bitcoin Script` allows you to run code on Bitcoin blockchain
 - Not Turing-Complete
 - It doesn't have the facility to code everything into the language
 - Doesn't have `loops` intentionally

`Solidity` allows youto run code on the Ethereum blockchain
 - Turing-Complete
 - Run on every single node on the chain
 - Loops can cause bugs like running forever but Solidity solves for this

Everyone in the network has:
 - History of all smart contracts
 - History of all transactions
 - Current state of all smart contracts
