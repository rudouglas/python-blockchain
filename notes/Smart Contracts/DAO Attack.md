One of the first DAOs was called DAO,
 - Started 2016
 - On Ethereum
 - Investor-directed venture capital fund
 - Stateless
 - Crowd funded ~$150 million

There was an error in the code for the smart contract governance
June 2016 Hacked ~$50 million

Because it is autonomous noone could do anything because you can't change the DAO

There was a failsafe mechanism that meant the hacker couldn't take the money to their personal account for 30 days so the community had time to act

Dilemma: `Code is Law?`

Some thought they shouldn't do anything because the DAO should be immutable, but the rest decided to do a hard-fork and reverse the rules of the contract

Ethereum split to ETH and ETC (Ethereum Classic)

Hacker walked away with ~$67 million in ETC

The bug was in DAO code not in Ethereum
